# (Implements | Fixes )

<!--- The purpose of creating a good PR is to present your work to the reviewer, so that it's easy to understand the task and its implementation. This also serves as our own documentation for each line of code we touch ✨ -->

## Summary ⚡️

<!--- Brief description (can be a single sentence) of what this PR does. Basically a TLDR; -->
<!--- For example: This PR fixes the issue where... This PR implements... -->

## Details 🕵️‍♀️

<!-- This section is optional. If your pull request is straight forward and doesn't need a detailed explanation then you are free to remove this section. -->

<!-- In this part we explain the important implementation details, such as describing the problem (e.g. I had to create a new component, which...), our approach to solve it (I implemented ... and ... in  order to...), and the decisions made when working on the implementation together with justification (e.g. I decided to go for this approach, because...). -->

<!-- It can be divided into multiple subsections to increase readability -->
<!-- Feel free to remove if you find them unnecessary or rename them if needed -->
<!-- Or even create your own sections that would help you structure the PR description -->

<!-- ### Brief description of the Task / Problem 😱 -->
<!-- Explain the task to the reviewer of your PR. What had to be done? -->

<!-- ### Implementation details / Chosen approach 🧙‍♂️ -->
<!-- What and how did you implement to make it work? Why did you make a decision to use approach X instead of Y (if you considered a few different options)? You can also mention the things you did not do and why -->

<!-- ### Possible follow up tasks / tickets 🤔 -->
<!-- Would it be necessary to create a follow up ticket for this task? If so, what would have to be done?-->

<!-- ### Additional comments and remarks 🧹 -->
<!-- What other things should the reviewer be aware of? Any potential problems? Any doubts regarding the implementation? -->

<!-- ### QA instructions 🧪 -->
<!-- If the ticket needs to be QA'd by another engineer, explain what exactly has to be tested in order to ensure its correct functionality -->

<!-- Other tips! -->
<!-- 1. You can add comments to specific lines of code to explain them better -->
<!-- 2. Try to be as concise as possible in your explanations -->
<!-- 3. You can add images to help visualize the problem (or the solution)  -->
<!-- 4. In general try to explain things like you would like them to be explained to you -->
